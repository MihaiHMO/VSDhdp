+ The generation of the `vsdmemsoc` design was successful after : change the pin order to have a clk pin more optimized and tweak the PL density 
+ Caravel integration: 
  + The design needs ~50 pins and the IOs available for `caravel` chip design are just ~30 
  + I have 3 options:
      + Use the `LA #logic analyzer` signals
      + Used `wishbone bus` to write Instruction code to the SRAM
      + Use a second copy of `caravel` to expand the GPIOs capability

+ **Wishbone** bus integration
